# Just-In-Time Securities Funding

Alpaca offers Just-In-Time (JIT) Securities funding which can be configured for partners upon request. When a partner is JIT enabled, Alpacaâ€™s system calculates the difference between inflow and outflow account activity and assesses a single wire amount. Inflows to Alpaca typically consist of executed buy trades, while outflows to the partner are made up of executed sell trades and dividend payments. Should the inflows exceed the outflows across your account base, you will be responsible for sending the funds to Alpaca in time for settlement. If the opposite is true, Alpaca will initiate the wire on the morning of settlement equal to the difference between the outflows and the inflows.

## **Daily Trading Limit Object**

The JIT Securities daily trading limit is set at the correspondent level and is used as the limit for the total amount due to Alpaca on the date of settlement. The limit in use returns the real time usage of this limit and is calculated by taking the net of trade and non-trade activity inflows and outflows. If the limit in use reaches the daily net limit, further purchasing activity will be halted, however, the limit can be adjusted by reaching out to Alpaca with the proposed new limit and the reason for the change.

```json
{
  "daily_net_limit_in_use": "150804",
  "daily_net_limit": "1000000"
}
